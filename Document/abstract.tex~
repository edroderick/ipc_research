Many modern robotic systems are being developed as a collection of independent processes. In order for these processes to function together,  one must employ an interprocess communication (IPC) system. There exist several different prebuilt options, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents an analysis the capabilities of four popular system (Sockets, ZeroMQ, ACH and ROS) and evaluates their performance based on latency and set of design goals in a real world application.
